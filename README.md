# Tetris game (CR7 edition)
I always loved to play Tetris and everyone who knows that I'm big CR7 fan.
So I decided to create in Python a Tetris game with some funny details, calling it Tetris CR7 edition.
Whenever we score (make a complete line), a SIUUU comes up. Believe it or not it makes the game funnier and maybe more difficult when the level is high.
